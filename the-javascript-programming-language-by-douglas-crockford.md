## The JavaScript Programming Language by Douglas Crockford
I just found and watched this great talk at Yahoo by [Crockford](http://crockford.com/) in 2007 and I'm sharing it with you.   

Why ?  

For those who doesn't know him yet, he is a teacher, [writter](http://javascript.crockford.com/), inventor of [JSON](http://www.json.org/), [jsLint](http://www.jslint.com/), a Guru and yes, he is a very opinionated person and is fine, in my opinion ðŸ˜‰

You can learn (in 1 hour and 50 mins) about the history of the language, its design, the **best and the worst parts**, the keys features and whats makes Javascript unique.  
He explains the most important features of the language like **function, arrays, objects, prototype, lambdas and closure** and how can you **avoid errors** in your programs using the good parts and with good practices.
